# Noctis IV+
Attempt at understanding and playing with the [Noctis](http://anynowhere.com/bb/index.php?l=D4JeGEdhacS6Srr6NfweDCUh&r=lYUhcug3l3hhX4s6Spx5) [IV+](http://anynowhere.com/bb/posts.php?t=4341) source code

## A story
One evening, ten years ago, I downloaded Noctis IV and ran it. While lying in bed later that night, I could not sleep.

My room was spacious and chilly, but it did not compare with the coldness and vastness of space. I wondered how a program small enough to fit on a floppy disk could be so _beautiful_. Back then, my interest in computing was forming, and—besides other events that guided me—those moments were definitive.

I told myself that I will understand how Noctis works someday.

Now, a decade later, here I am.
